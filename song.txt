Bad to the bone
 
On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
Said leave this one alone
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone, bad to the bone
B-b-b-b-bad, B-b-b-b-bad, B-b-b-b-bad, bad to the bone

I broke a thousand hearts
Before I met you
I'll break a thousand more baby
Before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell you honey
That I'm bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-b-b-b-bad, B-b-b-b-bad, B-b-b-b-bad, bad to the bone
